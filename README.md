# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed Alimrani

🎓 **Computer Engineer** | 🌱 **Recently Graduated**  
💡 Passionate about **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Back-End Engineering**  
📍 Gaza, Palestine  

I enjoy building things with **practical real-world impact**. I’m deeply interested in **math, science, and AI**, and I would love to explore **quantum computing** in the future.  
Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my **deep learning foundations** while developing hands-on, meaningful projects.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Damage_Vision (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)

 **Damage_Vision_project**

A learning-driven **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** project focused on **detecting and assessing building damage from images**.

The project starts with a **binary image classification model** (*destroyed vs. not destroyed*) and gradually evolves toward **multi-level and percentage-based damage assessment**, as my skills and understanding progress.

### 📌 What this project showcases:
- Step-by-step application of ML & DL concepts from the  
  *Deep Learning Specialization (deeplearning.ai)*
- Implementing core algorithms and neural networks while learning
- Image-based damage classification with a clean, modular code structure
- Continuous improvement of models, accuracy, and evaluation methods
- A real-world use case inspired by post-war damage assessment and reconstruction
