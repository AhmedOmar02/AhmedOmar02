# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed Alimrani

🎓 **Computer Engineer** | 🌱 **Recently Graduated**  
💡 Passionate about **Deep Learning**, **Machine Learning**, and **Back-End Engineering**  
📍 Gaza, Palestine  

I enjoy building intelligent systems, backend services, and applying AI to real-world problems. Currently, I’m focusing on strengthening my deep learning foundations while developing practical projects that showcase my growth.

🚀 **Featured Project: Damage\_Vision (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)**🧠 **Damage\_Vision\_project**

A learning-driven Machine Learning & Deep Learning project focused on **detecting and assessing building damage from images**.

The project starts with a **binary image classification model (destroyed vs. not destroyed)** and gradually evolves toward **multi-level and percentage-based damage assessment**, as my skills progress.

📌 **What this project showcases:**

*   Step-by-step application of ML & DL concepts from the _Deep Learning Specialization (deeplearning.ai)_
    
*   Implementing core algorithms and neural networks while learning
    
*   Image-based damage classification with a clean, modular code structure
    
*   Continuous improvement of models, accuracy, and evaluation methods
    
*   A real-world use case inspired by post-war damage assessment and reconstruction
